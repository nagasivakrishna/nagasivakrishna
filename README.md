# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
- I do pentesting and Bug bounty hunting
- And I play a lot of video games. Below are the list of some of the games i played and requires special mentions. 
  
### Some old school game recommendations (I'm building a list ðŸ˜Ž)

  - Commando bomb squad (The Goat!)
  - blood 2 (if you like halflife series)
  - Dark sector (very underrated)
  - Age of war (Music is the best)
  - Z-man (Old Flash game, not sure if you can get this anywhere tbh)
  - Spelunky (Me and my cousins used to spend almost weeks playing this game on old windows xp)

### Not so old - good side scrollers
  - Planet of lana (wholesome)
  - Inside (weird but in a good way)
  - Ori series (GOAT!)
